<p> Any	one	who	has	common	sense	will	remember	that	the	bewilderments	of	the
    eyes	are	of	two	kinds,	and	arise	from	two	causes,	either	from	coming	out	of	the
    light	or	from	going	into	the	light,	which	is	true	of	the	mind's	eye,	quite	as	much
    as	of	the	bodily	eye;	and	he	who	remembers	this	when	he	sees	any	one	whose
    vision	is	perplexed	and	weak,	will	not	be	too	ready	to	laugh;	he	will	first	ask
    whether	that	soul	of	man	has	come	out	of	the	brighter	life,	and	is	unable	to	see
    because	unaccustomed	to	the	dark,	or	having	turned	from	darkness	to	the	day	is
    dazzled	by	excess	of	light.	And	he	will	count	the	one	happy	in	his	condition	and
    state	of	being,	and	he	will	pity	the	other;	or,	if	he	have	a	mind	to	laugh	at	the
    soul	which	comes	from	below	into	the	light,	there	will	be	more	reason	in	this
    than	in	the	laugh	which	greets	him	who	returns	from	above	out	of	the	light	into
    the	den. 
 
     —Plato,	The	Republic</p>
     <p>“Every heart sings a song, incomplete, until another heart whispers back. Those who wish to sing always find a song. At the touch of a lover, everyone becomes a poet.”
― Plato</p>
<p>“Do not train a child to learn by force or harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.”
― Plato</p>
<p>“...and when one of them meets the other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and one will not be out of the other's sight, as I may say, even for a moment...”
― Plato, The Symposium</p>
<p>“According to Greek mythology, humans were originally created with four arms, four legs and a head with two faces. Fearing their power, Zeus split them into two separate parts, condemning them to spend their lives in search of their other halves.”
― Plato, The Symposium</p>
<p>“...and when one of them meets the other half, the actual half of himself, whether he be a lover of youth or a lover of another sort, the pair are lost in an amazement of love and friendship and intimacy and one will not be out of the other's sight, as I may say, even for a moment...”
― Plato, The Symposium</p>
<p> The number of cyberattacks has reached epidemic proportions. According to one report, the num
ber of new malware releases every month exceeds 20 million, and the total malware in existence is 
approaching 900 million variants. More than 11.5 billion records have been exposed through data 
breaches since 2005. In 2019, four out of every five organizations experienced at least one successful 
cyberattack, and more than one-third suffered six or more successful attacks.1 It is estimated that 
by 2021, a business will fall victim to a ransomware attack once every 11 seconds. Cybercrime will 
cost the world $6 trillion annually by 2021, an increase of 100 percent in just six years, representing 
the greatest transfer of economic wealth in human history.2 Compounding the problem, 85 percent 
of organizations are experiencing a shortfall of skilled security professionals.3
 The need to identify and defend against these continual attacks has created an essential work
force that is now at the very core of the information technology (IT) industry. Known as information 
security, these professionals are focused on protecting electronic information. Various elements of 
information security, such as application security, infrastructure security, forensics and malware 
analysis, and security leadership, along with several others, make up this workforce. The demand 
for certified professionals in information security has never been higher.
 When filling cybersecurity positions, an overwhelming majority of enterprises use the Comput
ing Technology Industry Association (CompTIA) Security+ certification to verify security compe
tency. Of the hundreds of security certifications currently available, Security+ is one of the most 
widely acclaimed security certifications. Because it is internationally recognized as validating a 
foundation level of security skills and knowledge, the Security+ certification has become the foun
dation for today’s IT security professionals. The value for an IT professional who holds a CompTIA 
security certification is significant. On average, an employee with a CompTIA certification com
mands a salary between 5 and 15 percent higher than their counterparts with similar qualifications 
but lacking a certification.
 The CompTIA Security+ certification is a vendor-neutral credential that requires passing the 
current certification exam SY0-601. A successful candidate has the knowledge and skills required 
to identify attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities; design a strong security architecture; implement 
security controls; be knowledgeable of security operations and incident response; and be well 
versed in governance, risk, and compliance requirements.
 Certification provides job applicants with more than a competitive edge over their noncer
tified counterparts competing for the same IT positions. Some institutions of higher education 
grant college credit to students who successfully pass certification exams, moving them fur
ther along in their degree programs. For those already employed, achieving a new certification 
increases job effectiveness, which opens doors for advancement and job security. Certification 
also gives individuals interested in careers in the military the ability to move into higher posi
tions more quickly.
 CompTIA® Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals, Seventh Edition, is intended to 
equip learners with the knowledge and skills needed to be information security IT professionals. 
Yet it is more than an “exam prep” book. While teaching the fundamentals of cybersecurity by 
using the CompTIA Security+ exam objectives as its framework, the book takes a comprehensive 
view of security by examining in depth today’s attacks against networks and endpoints and what is 
needed to defend against these attacks. Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals, Seventh 
Edition, is a valuable tool for those who want to learn about security and enter the field of infor
mation security. It also provides the foundation that will help prepare for the CompTIA Security+ 
certification exam. For more information on CompTIA Security+ certification, visit the CompTIA 
website at <a href=" https://www.comptia.org/"target="_blank">comptia.org</a>
