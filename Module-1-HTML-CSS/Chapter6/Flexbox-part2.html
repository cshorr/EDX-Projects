            <aside>For a long time I used to go to bed early. Sometimes, when I had put out my candle, my eyes would
                close
                so quickly that I had not even time to say “I’m going to sleep.”
            </aside>
            <main>And half an hour later the thought that it was time to go to sleep would awaken me: I would try to put
                away the book which, I imagined, was still in my hands, and to blow out the light; I had been thinking
                all
                the time, while I was asleep, of what I had just been reading, but my thoughts had run into a channel of
                their own, until I myself seemed actually to have become the subject of my book: a church, a quartet,
                the
                rivalry between François I and Charles V.
            </main>
            <section>This impression would persist for some moments after I was awake; it did not disturb my mind, but
                it
                lay like scales upon my eyes and prevented them from registering the fact that the candle was no longer
                burning.
