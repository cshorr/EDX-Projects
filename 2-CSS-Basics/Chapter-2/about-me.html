    <h3>My Hobbies:</h3> <!--a paragraph describing your favorite hobbies -->

    <p class="hobbies">
        I have many hobbies, though I don’t always have the time to enjoy them all. I used to do a lot of bicycling,
        beach hikes, kayaking, camping, fishing, and golf.
    </p>

    <p class="hobbies">
        Nowadays, I’m focused on building a better career, and my hobbies have evolved. I really enjoy working on PCs —
        I’ve built several, and even repurposed an old machine into a Linux file server with remote access.
    </p>

    <p class="hobbies">
        I like setting up and tinkering with networks. I’ve built a home network with a VPN routed through my firewall
        and router, and added several network switches so I can run wired Ethernet todevices anywhere thats not my desk.
    </p>

    <p class="hobbies">
        I also enjoy learning to code. I’m not very good at it yet — but I don’t care. I’ll practice until I’m a pro.
